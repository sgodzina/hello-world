# hello-world
This is my first step into something more that amateur coding.

My name is Sebastian and I'm semi-new into coding. My first time into coding was in school something about 12 years ago. In Poland it was called "Gimnazjum" but it was something like elementary school but with extra naming. So, we learnt how to code simple applications in Pascal. I loved that and I tried to learn something by myself after school and on holidays. At the end of the year I completly forgot about it and don't ever think about it for a couple of years.
After maybe 3-4 years in technical college I've learnt about C, how to code in it etc. It was something similar to Pascal but obviously different. On that same year I've also learnt about ladder (coding language for PLC drivers).
After all education I bought Raspberry Pi. Microcomputer which uses Python to run and compile applications on itself, you may know it. For me it was lucky shot. I loved Python on first sight. I've build some simple apps with blinking leds, dimming lights, etc. My first harder project was displaying tempreature, humidity and other values on 16 digit display. Later I've build my self simple robot which I've steer through smartphone. 
Next the hard times come to me. I don't wanto to talk about this but I gave up on everything. 6 painful years where I done nothing and here I am now. I want to be software developer. Now I'm learning from the begining how to code in python and deciaded to change my life 180 degrees. 
I hope, my visitor, that you are not bored until this line. Hope your life was better than mine.
